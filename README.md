## Notebooks

### 1. [Data Collection - SpaceX API](https://github.com/mohannadtazi/Applied-Data-Science-Capstone-IBM/blob/main/jupyter-labs-spacex-data-collection-api.ipynb)
   - Collects historical launch data from the SpaceX API, including details such as booster version, launch site, payload mass, and landing outcome.

### 2. [Data Collection - Web Scraping](https://github.com/mohannadtazi/Applied-Data-Science-Capstone-IBM/blob/main/jupyter-labs-webscraping.ipynb)
   - Scrapes additional data points to enhance the dataset used for predictions.

### 3. [Data Wrangling](https://github.com/mohannadtazi/Applied-Data-Science-Capstone-IBM/blob/main/edadataviz.ipynb)
   - Cleans and formats the data, handling missing values and ensuring itâ€™s structured for analysis.

### 4. [Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Data Visualization](https://github.com/mohannadtazi/Applied-Data-Science-Capstone-IBM/blob/main/jupyter-labs-eda-sql-coursera_sqllite.ipynb)
   - Visualizes key trends, relationships between payload and orbit type, and more using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.

### 5. [Interactive Maps and Dashboards](https://github.com/mohannadtazi/Applied-Data-Science-Capstone-IBM/blob/main/lab_jupyter_launch_site_location.ipynb)
   - Creates interactive maps using Folium and dashboards with Plotly Dash to visualize launch sites and success rates.

### 6. [Predictive Analysis (Classification Models)](https://github.com/mohannadtazi/Applied-Data-Science-Capstone-IBM/blob/main/SpaceX_Machine%20Learning%20Prediction_Part_5.ipynb)
   - Builds and evaluates machine learning classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.) to predict the likelihood of successful landings.

## Key Features

- **Data Wrangling**: Removed missing values, transformed data types, and scaled features for modeling.
- **EDA**: Insights into key factors like booster reuse, grid fins, and landing geography.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Built and evaluated several classification models to predict landing outcomes.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Visualized data using interactive tools to explore landing success.

## Conclusion

The project successfully demonstrates the use of machine learning to predict SpaceX Falcon 9 landings, which is crucial for reducing costs through reusability.
